Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

https://sergrojas29.github.io/ChallengeWeek4/

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```


## Troubleshooting 

If timer is goes past 0 then the time and end game breaks -fixed on rev3


## Usage

Take the quiz see the you score and see how it can maintian you score for the future.

## Notes
The visual concept of an early computer model gave way y implementing more code than need but was a welcome challenge.
For example, after the log in screen a typed-out animation is created referencing the The Matrix. Although a for loop could have written it out it would have written out the string in an instant. My solution was to use a interval timer but after finishing a setdelay() could have been less code and easier to read.
The question are a set array so can be changed in the code to add more without breaking the site.
